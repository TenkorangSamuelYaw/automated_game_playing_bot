Automated cookie clicker game. The cookie clicker game is an interesting and addictive game as well.
The more you people, the more upgrades you can buy, but as you can see this will consumer much of the user's time.
So, it got me thinking, why don't I use Python to create a bot that will play the game automatically, and purchase all upgrades as the user does manually.
This is sought a cheat for programming geeks.ðŸ˜Š
This fun project was built using the selenium webdriver module in python.
The selenium webdriver is mostly used for automation and testing.
The selenium webdriver can open your favorite browser automatically, as you do.
The selenium webdriver is used to scrape relevant HTML elements on the cookie clicker website, certain conditions are tested, and the game playing and purchasing of upgrades starts automatically.
The purchasing of upgrades is done every 5 secs, but you can change it if you like.
The bot is programmed to quit the game after 5 minutes, again you can change it if you like.
You can be the best cookie clicker player with most powerful upgrades without touching the game.ðŸ˜Š
Run this bot to see how interesting it is to play cookie clicker automatically.
